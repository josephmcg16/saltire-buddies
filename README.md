# saltire-buddies
Autonomous candidate to buddy assigning based on candidates info and interests.  
Should also contain the option for candidate to select a random option in the 
case they are not sure what they want to do.

Using Google-drive form (or similar) try to develop a fancy script that can automatically assign drive entries into a name?

Essentially assign a score based on compatibility with alumni.  
Can use RNG and a limiter to insure the assigning of Candidates is spread out well.

Drive python api: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python  
Or pydrive package: https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/

GDPR standards **must** be adhered too.

Can just test the script with a test form/ contact info.
Need to find out how the saltire people save the data. I'd assume a google/ one drive thing.
Hopefully don't need to pay for a developer cloud licence, might be spenny.
Would prefer open-source methods.

Email me for any questions!
